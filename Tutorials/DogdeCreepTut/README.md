# DogdeCreepTut
This repo is branch of original GodotAIGym to use the frame screen as the input of Neural Network.

## Python Dependencies
1. ZeroMQ
2. GodotAIGym
4. Tensorflow 2.4.1
5. Tensorflow Probability 0.11.0
6. OpenCV
7. Gym

## How to run
1. First, you need to install the GodotAIGym module by following [instruction of master branch](https://github.com/lupoglaz/GodotAIGym).
2. Please test the [original agent of master branch](https://github.com/lupoglaz/GodotAIGym/tree/master/Tutorials/InvPendulumTut).

3. If you can install and run the master branch, try to run the example of this repo by using below command. Different from master branch, it use the frame screen image as input. It should start to run the environment and show game screen and gray scale image of that. 
```
$ python env_test.py
```

4. If you can see the above image, try to train the agent using below command. It should start to run the 1 Godot games.
```
$ ./run_reinforcement_learning.sh 1
```

:warning:  Please ignore the below error when running the learner.py file. It can be ignored.
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "learner.py", line 381, in <module>
    coord.join(thread_data)
  File "/home/kimbring2/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/coordinator.py", line 353, in join
    threads = self._registered_threads.union(set(threads))
TypeError: 'Thread' object is not iterable
```

5. You can stop the training by using below command.
```
$ ./stop.sh
```

6. You can see the training progress by using the Tensorboard under the tensorboard folder.
```
$ tensorboard --logdir=./tensorboard
```

7. You can see also the agent start to collect the coin after few hours later.
